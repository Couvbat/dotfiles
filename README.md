# Couvbat Dotfiles for Hyprland

An advanced configuration of Hyprland for Arch Linux based distributions. This package includes an installation script to install and set up the required components.

## Installation

The installation could not work on all Arch Linux distribution as I tailored this install to my own laptop's system.

I recommend to install a base Hyprland system before installing the ML4W Hyprland Dotfiles. Then you have a stable starting point and can test Hyprland on your system beforehand. Hyprland is complex, under ongoing development, and requires additional components.

You can find the Hyprland installation instructions here: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/

> IMPORTANT: Please make sure that all packages on your system are updated before running the installation script.

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution, setup, and personal configuration can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the Couvbat Dotfiles will work everywhere. You install at your own risk.

### Arch Linux (based)

```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Couvbat/dotfiles/main/install.sh)
```

Please rebuild all packages to ensure that you get the latest commit.
